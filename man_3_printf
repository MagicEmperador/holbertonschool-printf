NAME

	_printf - formatted output function

SYNOPSIS

	#include <stdio.h>

	int _printf(const char *format, ...)


DESCRIPTION

	The function _printf is used to output different data types passed as arguments. The function prints arguments like char, char *, int, long int using the '%'
	placeholder followed by a character.

RETURN VALUE

       Upon successful return, the function _printf returns the number of characters printed, excluding the null byte used to end output to strings.


EXAMPLES

	1. Printing chars using %c (a format specifier to handle characters) within the function _printf

	   _printf("Character:[%c]\n", 'H');

	   will print to screen:

	   Character:[H]


	2. Printing strings using %s (a format specifier to handle string) within the function _printf.

	   _printf("String:[%s]\n", "I am a string !");

	   will print to screen:

	   String:[I am a string !]


	3. Printing percentage symbol '%' by using '%%' in the format string. This is because '%' is a special character in the function _printf format strings and is used
	   to indicate format specifiers. When _printf function encounters '%%' in the format string, it will print a single '%' character to the output. The first '%'
	   serves as an escape character, indicating to _printf function that the second '%' should be treated as a literal character to be printed, rather than a
	   beginning of a format specifier.

	   _printf("Percent:[%%]\n");

	   will print to screen:

	   Percent:[%]


	4. Printing signed decimal integers (both positive and negative) using %d format specifier withing the function _printf.

	   _printf("Negative:[%d]\n", -762534);

	   will print to screen:

	   Negative:[-762534]


	5. Printing integers using %i (a format specifier to handle integers of decimal, hexadecimal or octal type) within the function _printf.

	   unsigned int ui;
	   void *addr;

	   _printf("Unsigned:[%u]\n", ui);

	   will print to screen:

	   Unsigned:[2147484671]


	   _printf("Unsigned octal:[%o]\n", ui);

	   will print to screen:

	   Unsigned octal:[20000001777]


	   _printf("Unsigned hexadecimal:[%x, %X]\n", ui, ui);

	   will print to screen:

	   Unsigned hexadecimal:[800003ff, 800003FF]
